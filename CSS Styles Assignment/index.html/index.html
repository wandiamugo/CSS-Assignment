    <h1 class="underline">CSS Basics</h1>
    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code that <strong>styles</strong> web content. CSS basics walks through what you need to get started. We'll answer questions like: How do I make text red? How do I make content display at a certain location in the (webpage) layout? How do I decorate my webpage with background images and colors?</p>
    <h2 class="underline">What is CSS?</h2>
    <p>Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language either. CSS is a <strong>style sheet language</strong>. CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements.</p>
    <h2 class="underline">Anatomy of a CSS ruleset</h2>
    <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics/css-declaration-small.png"width=400>
    <p>The whole structure is called a ruleset. (The term ruleset is often referred to as just rule.) Note the names of the individual parts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Selector</strong><br/>
        This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. It defines the element(s) to be styled (in this example,<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p" target="_blank"> < p > </a> elements). To style a different element, change the selector.</li><br/>
      <li><strong>Declaration</strong><br/>
        This is a single rule like color: red;. It specifies which of the element's properties you want to style</li><br/>
      <li><strong>Properties</strong><br/>
        These are ways in which you can style an HTML element. (In this example, color is a property of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p" target="_blank"> < p></p></a> elements.) In CSS, you choose which properties you want to affect in the rule.</li><br/>
      <li><strong>Property Value</strong><br/>
        To the right of the property—after the colon—there is the property value. This chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given property. (For example, there are many color values in addition to red.)</li>
    </ul><br/>
    <p>Note the other important parts of the syntax:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Apart from the selector, each ruleset must be wrapped in curly braces. ({})</li>
      <li>Within each declaration, you must use a colon (:) to separate the property from its value or values.</li>
      <li>Within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon (;) to separate each declaration from the next one.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="underline">CSS: all about boxes</h2>
    <p>Something you'll notice about writing CSS: a lot of it is about boxes. This includes setting size, color, and position. Most HTML elements on your page can be thought of as boxes sitting on top of other boxes.</p>
    <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics/boxes.jpg " width="=400" >
    <p>CSS layout is mostly based on the <strong>box</strong> model. Each box taking up space on your page has properties like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>padding, the space around the content. In the example below, it is the space around the paragraph text.</li>
      <li>border, the solid line that is just outside the padding.</li>
      <li>margin, the space around the outside of the border.</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics/box-model.png"width=400>
    <p>In this section we also use:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>width (of an element).</li>
      <li>background-color, the color behind an element's content and padding.</li>
      <li>color, the color of an element's content (usually text).</li>
      <li>text-shadow sets a drop shadow on the text inside an element.</li>
      <li>display sets the display mode of an element. (keep reading to learn more)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We have barely scratched the surface of CSS</p>
